# project_1_web_scrapping
The aim of this project is to scrape the data found on UFC's stat website, clean it and store on an AWS's RDS.

Which will later be used in making a model to come up with the most efficient way of fighting depending on your oponents style.

An oponents style can be defined by what part of the body to they mainly strike and their success.

By running the UFC_data.py python file you will see that a database is populated containing all the fighting stats ranging from present to 1994.
Which also allow us to visualise the developement in technique for MMA over the yeas.

This project allowed to me to understand the process of webscrapping, data cleaning and storing.
In total there 12k+ data entries.
